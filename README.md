# Ghidra FindCrypt

This is a re-write of another [Ghidra FindCrypt](https://github.com/d3v1l401/FindCrypt-Ghidra/) script
in python. It also takes better advantage of the Ghidra
API to label found constants.

Add this repo to your Ghidra script path. The script is located
under "Data/Crypt" in the script manager.
